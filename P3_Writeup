**Behavioral Cloning**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

###Data Load
* German traffic signs data was dowloaded from source and unzipped to get the pickle files
* Train, Validation and Test datasets were extracted from pickle files
